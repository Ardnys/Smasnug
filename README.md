It's a phone book application where you store your contacts.
After careful consideration, I decided to not go with the Smasnug theme, mostly because I was scared of getting a low grade in case my "funny" joke goes unnoticed. So after a quick web browsing the theme switched to 90s popular anime Cowboy Bebop.

# Deployment
I have no idea what I am doing so I failed to deploy the website to Github Pages. I am sorry you have to clone it and `npm run dev` it.
Also don't forget to `cd WebServer` and `python server.py` to start the server.
Also github pages only support static websites so this is not even suitable for that. No deployment for this monster.

# Or do you?
Well I took screenshots so you don't have to host my awesome website in your local machine. You are missing the Vite + React template glow animation that I very conveniently overused, but oh well.

**Landing page / Login Screen** \

**Dashboard / Main Menu** \
The app has the Bebop crew by default. \

**Edit Contact** \
Default crew members' glow effect is their pictures color and looks nice. \

**Add Contact** \
This one glows red and looks nice. \

**Search Contact** \
Very sophisticated searching algorithm in action. Also newly added contacts have Ed and Ein picture and glow purple and looks nice. \

# Web server
As if all this isn't enough, this thing is getting A SERVER and A DATABASE! Phew we are living on the edge. \
After a lot of agonizing hours in front of the keeb and discussions with knowledgeable people and googling and prompting mildly helpful AI assistant, I am calling it done. I can't show you a working example unless you follow my professional deployment guide, so please take my word for it. \
I quit, 10/12/2023 23:11 PM.
