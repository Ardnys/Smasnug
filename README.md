It's a phone book application where you store your contacts. But here's the catch: I made it in 2 days without knowing anything so it's really bad. Smasnug theme thus fits too well. 
After careful consideration, I decided to not go with the Smasnug theme, mostly because I was scared of getting a low grade in case my "funny" joke goes unnoticed. So after a quick web browsing the theme switched to 90s popular anime Cowboy Bebop.

# Cowboy Bebop
Cowboy Bebop theme fits my website for many reasons:
- I like 90s hit anime Cowboy Bebop
- Having default characters (contacts) in the website is really handy.
- Easy to find cool images
- Nice color theme
- It's possibly more understandble than "Smasnug"
- There's some idea so maybe I can add more stuff in the feature.

# Deployment
I have no idea what I am doing so I failed to deploy the website to Github Pages. I am sorry you have to clone it and `npm run dev` it. 

# Or do you?
Well I took screenshots so you don't have to host my terrible code in your local machine. You are missing the Vite + React template glow animation that I very conveniently overused, but oh well. You are not missing out.

**Landing page / Login Screen** \

**Dashboard / Main Menu** \
The app has the Bebop crew by default. \

**Edit Contact** \
Default crew members' glow effect is their pictures color and looks nice. \

**Add Contact** \
This one glows red and looks nice. \

**Search Contact** \
Very sophisticated searching algorithm in action. Also newly added contacts have Ed and Ein picture and glow purple and looks nice. \

# Web server
As if all this isn't enough, this thing is getting A SERVER and A DATABASE! Phew we are living on the edge.\
Previously I didn't know what I was doing but at least I had very little idea of the things appearing on the screen and as long as they appeared I assumed they work. 
Now, not only I have quite literally NO IDEA what's going on, I can do nothing but cross my fingers like a Torcettini Di Saint Vincent and hope that some code on the internet works. \
